**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Likashmi Deosaran

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

I used google with some help from mainly https://stackoverflow.com/.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

The problem I encountered while working on this project was hiding elements such as buttons. As I wasn't familiar with the HTML language I didn't really understand the instructions explaining how to hide elements. I wanted to figure it out on my own but the java version of this code was different so I was unsure how exactly to implement the code. After reading through the instructions again and seeing that we can call the button a class and then make it hidden, I got some more clarification on how this code can be used. After reading that and realizing that within HTML the greater than sign works in a similar way to parentheses in java and from then on my understanding of HTML code started to clear up. From then on I Knew how to solve the problem I encountered and I also started to understand the HTML code.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

After finishing the project, I realized I didn't know you could have done so much using other languages. The only coding knowledge I have is within Java which is more backend coding. This project was my first experience with front-end coding. I want to learn more about how to make front-end applications because it is the part of coding with which the users interact with the most. Im also really interested in how the front end and backend communicate and what goes into the design of a web page. And as an engineering major, I really would like to see the application of frontend coding and relating to hardware.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had more time I would have liked to personalize my game more. As I was very unfamiliar with the code languages used on the glitch platform it took a while for me to start translating how I would do something in java and converting that to CSS or JS. The first thing I would have done was try to randomize the sequence on every play-through. I think this very feasible thing that I could do at my current level within coding. As I know how to use for loops and else loops I would believe that I would be able to randomize the sequence. I would also like to add different sounds instead of changing the frequencies, I would like to make the sounds connect. Like for example make the notes make a melody. I would also like to add pictures but that's stepping into territory that I'm not really familiar with within code.
